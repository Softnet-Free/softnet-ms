## 5.1. MY DOMAINS

The <span class="header-green">MY DOMAINS</span> page represents a list of domains. Clicking on the "Domains" item of the main menu takes you to the page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.1_1.png %})

Each item in the list is a reference that opens the domain manager. To edit the list, click the "edit" button at the top right of the panel's working area. This button switches the list manager to edit mode. Clicking the "view" button switches the list manager back to view mode. Below is the manager in edit mode:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.1_2.png %})

In edit mode, each item in the list acquires two buttons: "<span class="text-blue">&gt;&gt;</span>" and "<span class="text-red">X</span>", which makes available two operations on the domain: changing the domain name and deleting the domain. On the image below, the domain name "Green House" is being edited:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.1_3.png %})

If you click the "<span class="text-red">X</span>" button before deleting the domain, you'll be asked to confirm the deletion:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.1_4.png %})
