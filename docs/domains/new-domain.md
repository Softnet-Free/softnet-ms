## 5.2. Creating a domain

To create a domain, click the "Domains" item of the main menu:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.2_1.png %})

Click "new domain" to open the "New Domain" page:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.2_2.png %})

Type the name of the project you want to create:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.2_3.png %})

And click "Create". Then youâ€™ll be taken to the domain page:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_dmn.2_4.png %})

The newly created domain contains nothing but two users: **Owner** and **Guest**. **Owner** is a generic user that represents the project owner. Typically, this is the most authoritative user in a domain. Clients associated with **Owner** interact with services deployed in the domain on behalf of the project owner. **Guest** is a generic user that represents all anonymous clients.
