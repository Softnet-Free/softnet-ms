# The User Guide to Softnet Management System
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

## Abstract

This guide is developed for Softnet users. It explains how to use Softnet MS for managing autonomous devices and clients utilizing the Softnet platform. We call a device autonomous if it is able to perform autonomous behavior and interact with clients over IP networks. However, software for PCs, laptops and smartphones can also be designed to communicate using the Softnet platform. This guide explains how to create IoT projects, set up devices and clients, assign access rights to users, share your devices with contacts as well as consume devices that your contacts share with you. It's worth noting that using Softnet MS is as simple as using, for example, a social media site.  

If you want to quickly deploy a single device, the "[Deploying a single device]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/single/index.md %})" chapter explains this subject without diving into details. To quickly deploy multiple identical devices, you can skip ahead to the "[Deploying multiple identical devices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/multi/index.md %})" chapter. In order to deploy complex IoT projects and use all the features of the system, you need to know a little more about the system. The first chapter, "[Fundamentals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals.md %})", explains the terms and principles used in Softnet MS.
