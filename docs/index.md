# The User Guide to Softnet Management System
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

## Abstract

This guide is developed for Softnet users. It explains how to use Softnet MS for managing autonomous devices and clients utilizing the Softnet platform. We call a device autonomous if it is able to perform autonomous behavior and interact with clients over IP networks. However, software for PCs, laptops and smartphones can also be designed to use the Softnet platform. This guide explains how to create IoT projects, set up devices and clients, assign access rights to users, share your devices with contacts as well as consume devices that your contacts share with you. It's worth noting that using Softnet MS is as simple as using, for example, a social media site.
