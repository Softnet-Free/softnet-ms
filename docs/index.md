# The User Guide to Softnet Management System
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

## Abstract

This guide is developed for Softnet users. It explains how to use Softnet MS for managing autonomous devices and clients utilizing the Softnet platform. We call a device autonomous if it is able to perform autonomous behavior and interact with clients over IP networks. However, software for PCs, laptops and smartphones can also be designed to communicate using the Softnet platform. This guide explains how to create IoT projects, set up devices and clients, assign access rights to users, share your devices with contacts as well as consume devices that your contacts share with you. It's worth noting that using Softnet MS is as simple as using, for example, a social media site.  

The [first chapter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/registration/index.md %}) of the guide explains two methods of registering with Softnet MS. If you want to quickly deploy a single device, the "[Quickly deploying a single device]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/single/index.md %})" chapter explains this subject without diving into details. To quickly deploy a few identical devices, you can skip ahead to the "[Quickly deploying identical devices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/multi/index.md %})" chapter. To deploy complex IoT projects and take full advantage of the system, you need to learn a little more about the system. Thus, in the fourth chapter "[Fundamentals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals.md %})" the terms and principles used in Softnet MS are explained. And the following chapters, starting from 5th to 12th, explain every aspect of deploying and managing complex IoT projects. Finally, the 13th chapter gives recommendations for Softnet developers.
