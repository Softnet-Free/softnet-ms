## 8.2. Sending a contact invitation

To create a contact with a person or organization, you first need to find them and send an invitation. Clicking the "<span class="text-cyan">new invitation</span>" button takes you to the "<span class="header-green">NEW INVITATION</span>" page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_1.png %})

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_2.png %})

Enter a name filter in the search field and click "Go". As a filter, you can use an expression consisting of parts of the name separated by a space. If you enter an empty string, you can view the entire list of persons and organizations in alphabetical order, displayed in pages of 15 names.  

In the image below, "s ger" is used to search for Sophie German:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_3.png %})

The following image shows the first page of the entire list:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_4.png %})

Click the name you want to send an invitation. In the image below, an invitation is sent to Karina Koifman:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_5.png %})

Now in "<span class="header-green">INVITATIONS SENT</span>", there is a new item, Karina Koifman:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.2_6.png %})

After the invitation sent, the contact will be created when your counterparty accepts the invitation. The [next section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/contacts/handling-inv.md %}) discusses handling an invitation.
