# 8. Contacts & partnerships

In Softnet MS, you can share access to devices with your partners, as well as consume devices that your partners share with you. Softnet uses the concept of **contacts** well known to all of us from social networks. A contact can be created with a person or organization registered on the same Softnet server as you. First, you send an invitation to them. And if they accept it, the contact is created. In a domain, you can create Contact users associated with your contacts and assign them access rights to services in the same way as you do it with Private users and Owner. Your partners can see what services you share with them and with what permissions. And they themselves can create and manage client entities on the sites.
