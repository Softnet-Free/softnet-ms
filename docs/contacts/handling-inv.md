## 8.3. Handling a contact invitation

When you receive a contact invitation, the management panel displays a corresponding notification on the right side of the main menu. In the following image, Karina Koifman received an invitation, which is shown by the message "<span class="text-orange">invitations: 1</span>" 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_1.png %})

Clicking the notification message takes you to the INVITATIONS RECEIVED page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_2.png %})

If your counterparty accepts the contact invitation, a corresponding contact will be added to your contact list, and to a contact list of your counterparty. Thus you become partners. In the following image, Karina Koifman has accepted the invitation and John Doe has been added to her contact list:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_3.png %})

Similarly, Karina Koifman has been added to the contact list of John Doe:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_4.png %})

John Doe can set the user default name for this contact, such as "Karina":

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_5.png %})

The user default name is used by the "New User" form to fill the "user name" field:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_cont.3_6.png %})
