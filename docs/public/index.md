# 12. Public services

In Softnet, services that provide guest access are called public services. Users can find public services they are interested in on the page "Public Services". How a Softnet user manages guest clients of public services depends on whether the user has an account with Softnet MS.

## 12.1. Public services for registered Softnet users

A logged-in user can open the "Public Services" page by clicking the main menu item "Public -> Public Services":

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_public.1_1.png %})

First, the user searches for the service owner. As a search filter, the user can use an expression consisting of parts of the name separated by a space. If the search filter is an empty string, the system returns the entire list of persons and organizations in alphabetical order, displayed on pages of 15 names.  

In the image below, “mar” is used to search for Markus Schmidt:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_public.1_2.png %})

If the service owner is found, clicking on their name opens the page that displays all the owner's domains with public services. In the next image, Markus Schmidt has two domains with public services:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_public.1_3.png %})

And in the next image, the "Holiday Vision" domain is opened:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_public.1_4.png %})

All client entities created in the "Public services" section then appear in the "My Guest Clients" section of the user and can be managed in the usual manner.

## 12.2. Public services for anonymous Softnet users

A user that is not logged-in on Softnet MS can open the "Public Services" page by clicking the main menu item "Public Services":

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_public.2_1.png %})
