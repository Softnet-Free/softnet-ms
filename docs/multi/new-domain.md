## 3.1. Creating a domain

To deploy a project, we create a domain as it is demonstrated in section "[Creating a domain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/domains/new-domain.md %})" of the "Domains & projects" chapter. Let's name the domain "Home Surveillance":  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_mdp.1_1.png %})

Our newly created domain contains a user called **Owner** which represents the project owner, and a user called **Guest** which represents anonymous clients that we don't use in this project:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_mdp.1_2.png %})
