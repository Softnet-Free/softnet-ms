## 6.3. Site management

This section explores the site management operations. The "<span class="text-blue">site</span>" section of the <span class="header-green">SITE CONFIGURATION</span> panel contains two menu buttons: "<span class="text-cyan">description</span>" and "<span class="text-cyan">enable/disable</span>". The first button allows you to change the site description. And the second button allows you to enable/disable site. Clicking the "<span class="text-red">X</span>" button at the upper right coner of the  panel deletes the site:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_1.png %})

### 6.3.1. Site description

The "<span class="text-cyan">description</span>" button opens the editor where you can change the site description:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_2.png %})

Changing the site description can be useful if you have many different sites in the domain or you are going to share the devices on the site with your contacts. As a site description, you can specify the location of the device or the role it plays in the project. In the following image, for our Baby Monitor example, the site description is changed to "Bedroom":

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_3.png %})

### 6.3.2. Site enabling / disabling

You can use site disabling to temporarily suspend communication between the device and its clients. The "<span class="text-cyan">enable/disable</span>" menu button shows the site's current enabled/disabled status, as well as a button to disable the site if it is enabled, or a button to enable the site if it is disabled.  

The image below shows the site status as "<span class="text-green">enabled</span>" and a button to disable it:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_4.png %})

The next image shows the site status as "<span class="text-red">disabled</span>" and a button to enable it:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_5.png %})

### 6.3.3. Site deleting

To delete the site, click the "<span class="text-red">X</span>" button at the upper right coner of the  panel. It takes you to the page where you will be asked to confirm the site deletion:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_ssite.3_6.png %})
