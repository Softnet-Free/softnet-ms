## 9.2. User list management

This section describes operations on a list of domain users and uses the demo project "Office Automation" for demonstration purposes. Currently, the demo project's domain contains two integrated users: Owner and Guest. Below is a view of the domain:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_usr.2_1.png %})

In addition, we create two Private users and two contact users. The Private users, called "Operator" and "GuardPost", are used for client applications deployed in the operator's room and at the guard post. Let's create them. Clicking the "<span class="text-blue">new user</span>" button takes us to the NEW USER page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_usr.2_2.png %})

If you are creating a Private user, you need the "PRIVATE USER" section of the panel. For our example, we enter the name "Operator" in the "user name" field and, leaving the "Dedicated" box unchecked, click "Create". We do the same for the second user "GuardPost". Now the user list has the following view:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_usr.2_3.png %})


You can see that to the right of the "user name" field there is a checkbox "Dedicated".
