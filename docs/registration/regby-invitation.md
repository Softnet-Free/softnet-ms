## 1.2. Registering by invitation

If the "New User" button is not shown at the top right of the panel, creating an account is possible only by an invitation URL provided by the administrator:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_2.2_1.png %})

To create an account by invitation, provide the administrator with your email address or any other contact to receive the message. An invitation message received by email might look like this:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_2.2_2.png %})

If you get the invitation URL itself, it might look something like this:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_2.2_3.png %})

If you follow the invitation URL, you will be taken to the registration page:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_2.2_4.png %})

Type the required parameters and create an account. If everything is Ok, youâ€™ll be taken to the "Log In" page:  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/image_2.2_5.png %})
